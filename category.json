  "The plane landed in the shallow waters of San Francisco Bay, 2.5 mile short of the Runway 28L. All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft.

  "The aircraft crashed into Santa Monica Bay shortly after a night takeoff in poor weather and visibility. The aircraft was dispatched with the No. 3 generator inoperative. While this was allowed, United was required to repair the generator at the first airport where there were repair facilities. The aircraft flew for a total of 41 hours with the inoperative generator passing through airports that had the facilities to repair the generator. Soon after taking off, the crew reported a fire warning in the No. 1 engine and shut it down as required. For reasons that could not be determined, shutting down the No. 1 engine and itÃ¢ÂÂs generator tripped the No.2 generator resulting in the loss of all electrical power in the aircraft. Following loss of all electrical power, the battery standby electrical system either was not activated or failed to function. Electrical power at a voltage level of approximately 50 volts was restored approximately a minute and a half after loss of the No. 2 generator. The duration of this power restoration was just 9 to 15 seconds. Regardless, the pilots did not have functioning attitude indicators from the time the No. 2 generator tripped. In the dark, with no outside or inside reference to guide them, the pilots became spatially disoriented and the plane eventually went into a dive and crashed into the Pacific Ocean 11.3 miles west of the airport and sank in 950 ft. of water. The accident was caused by the loss of attitude orientation during a night, instrument departure in which all attitude instruments were disabled by loss of electrical power. The investigation was not able to determine (a) why all generator power was lost or (b) why the standby electrical power system either was not activated or failed to function.\" One unproven scenario that is not contradicted by available evidence was the inadvertent placement of the battery switch to the \"OFF\" position by the flight engineer during attempts to remove galley loads from the generator buses.

  "The civilian Iranian airliner was shot down by the U.S. Navy vessel U.S.S. Vincennes with surface-to-air missiles. The Vincennes was protecting other civilian ships in the area from Iranian gunboats. The Vincennes responded to hostile action taking place against a ship by Iranian gun boats. However, orders to the captain were to send a helicopter to investigate but maintain position. In fact, the ship headed towards the hostilities and penetrated 2nm inside Iranian territorial waters and after the helicopter was fired upon, engaged the enemy boats. The ill-fated airliner was delayed in leaving Bandar Abbas because of a problem with the passport of a passenger. Soon after taking off the target appeared on the radar of the Vincennes. Because the plane was late and confusion of time zones, the crew was not expecting an airliner in the area. When the target was first identified, it squawked both 2 (military) and 3 (civilian). The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate.

Nine passengers were sucked out of the plane and lost at sea. The plane landed safely. The cargo door opening was attributed to a faulty switch or wiring in the door control system which permitted electrical actuation of the door latches towards the unlatched position after initial door closure and before takeoff. As a failsafe, the latches should have been blocked from moving by a mechanism called a \"locking sector\" (one on each latch), engaged manually by a lever after the door is closed.  However, the locking sectors as designed were not strong enough and could be overcome by the motors which was a design flaw right from the introduction of the747.  This was finally recognized as serious, after a non-fatal failure in 1987, but installing stronger locking sectors required taking each plane out of service 10 hours, and the FAA had allowed airlines 18 months so they could do it during other maintenance procedures.": "Faulty switch",

  "The aircraft was put in a series of extended holding patterns as it approached New York.The crew informed ATC they were running out of fuel but did not declare an emergency and were cleared to land. After a missed approach and during  a go-around, the plane ran out of fuel and crashed in a wooded area. The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term \"we need priority\" several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say \"we are running out of fuel\" numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted. Although the major blame was placed on the crew, in the end, the FAA paid 40% of compensations to the passenger's families.": "Communication",

The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence.": "Jam",

  "The aircraft was in a holding pattern and was descending to a newly assigned altitude of 8,000 feet when it experienced an uncommanded roll and excursion and crashed during a rapid descent. Icing. The design of the rubber de-icing boot was insufficient to deal with icing on the wings. Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover. Contributing factor was the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's inadequate oversight of the ATR42 and ATR 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions and failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions.": "Icing",

  "The pilot reported that an engine failed just as he started to descend for a landing. He later informed ATC he could not feather the propeller. The  aircraft subsequently crashed and burned in a field.  The accident was due to inappropriate management of the flight following jamming of the propeller in an intermediate position after the right engine crankshaft ruptured. The inappropriate management was due to the pilotÃ¢ÂÂs relative lack of experience on this aircraft type, his false notions about the aircraftÃ¢ÂÂs performance and about the existence of a flight level to maintain level flight with an unfeathered propeller and an heavy aircraft and a series of misjudged strategies to attempt to continue the flight then to land at Limoges when the aircraftÃ¢ÂÂs altitude no longer made this possible.": "Inappropriate management",
  "Midair collision 17 km W of New Delhi.  The Saudi 747 had just taken off from New Delhi airport ascending to 14,000 feet while the Il-76 was descending. Three hundred twelve aboard the B-747 and thirty-seven aboard the Il-76 were killed. The Il-76 descended below its assigned altitude. The death toll was reduced from 351 to 349 after Kazakstan Airlines reported 37 aboard rather than 39. Neither aircraft was equipped with an Airborne Collision Avoidance System. The 747 had taken off from Delhi and had been cleared to climb to FL140.  Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation due to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight.": "Misunderstanding",

Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge.": "Rudder",
  "A few minutes after takeoff a distress call was received from the aircraft after which it ditched into the sea 200 yards offshore. The pilot's disregard for lateral fuel loading limits, his improper removal of frost prior to takeoff, and the resulting inadvertent stall/spin.

The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulic fluid. When hydraulic fluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulic system. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn.

  "While making a landing in strong winds and rain, the pilot-in-command disconnected the autopilot but left the autothrottle engaged. The aircraft, with a weight close to the maximum landing weight permitted, stabilized slightly low on the glideslope. An attempt was made to flare but the aircraft landed hard on its right landing gear and the No.3 engine touched the runway. The right main landing gear and right wing separated. The MD-11 then inverted and skidded off the runway in flames. Probable Cause: The commander's unability to arrest the high rate of descent existing at 50 ft. RA. Contributory Causes:  The commander's failure to appreciate the combination of a reducing airspeed, increasing rate of descent, and with the thrust decreasing to flight idle. The commander's failure to apply power to counteract the high rate of descent prior to touchdown. Probable variations in wind direction and speed below 50 ft RA may have resulted in a momentary loss of headwind component and, in combination with the early retardation of the thrust levers, and at a weight only just below the maximum landing weight, led to a 20 kt loss in indicated airspeed just prior to touchdown. A possible contributory cause may have been a reduction in peripheral vision as the aircraft entered the area of the landing flare, resulting in the commander not appreciating the high rate of descent prior to touchdown.": "Unradar",

Soon after, the pitch decreased rapidly accompanied by a marked speed increase and plane entered a high speed, high-rate, spiral descent and crashed into an open field. The flight crew reacted inappropriately to the change in departure clearance SID ZUE 1Y by ATC. The first officer made an entry in the FMS, without being instructed to do so by the commander, which related to the change to the SID ZUE 1 standard instrument departure. In doing so, he omitted to select a turn direction. The captain dispensed with use of the autopilot under instrument flight conditions and during the work-intensive climb phase of the flight.

While preparing to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport control was lost and the MD-83 was seen in a nose-down attitude, spinning and tumbling in a continuous roll, inverted, before it impacted the sea.  Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophic effects of total acme nut thread loss.

  "Three minutes after taking off and while in a climbing left turn, at 2,800 ft., parts of the plane, including the vertical stabilizer and rudder, fell from the aircraft. The crew soon lost control of the plane which nose dived and crashed into a residential neighborhood. After flying into the wake turbulence of two aircraft about two minutes into the flight, investigators believe a series of quick rudder swings by the copilot whipped the tail so severely that the fin broke off. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that pilot error was the probable cause. Sharply criticizing American Airlines Advanced Aircraft Maneuvering Program, the Board said that American Airlines' pilot training included a simulator exercise which could have caused the first officer to have an unrealistic and exaggerated view of the effects of wake turbulence, erroneously associate wake turbulence encounters with the need for aggressive roll upset recovery techniques and develop control strategies that would produce a much different -- and potentially surprising and confusing -- response if performed during flight.

The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings.

The controller's Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System issued and alert during the last two radar returns. The air traffic controller failed to alert the crew to altitude warnings as the plane was on track to fly into a mountain. The controller identified the airplane on the radar screen and instructed crew members to expect clearance above 5,000 feet, but then issued a heading that resulted in a flight track directly into the mountains. The mountain is at 3,556 feet altitude. Also, the flight crew did not follow the recommended departure procedures for taking off at night and in mountainous terrain. Failure of the flightcrew to maintain terrain clearance during a VFR departure, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain, and the air traffic controller's issuance of a clearance that transferred the responsibility for terrain clearance from the fllightcrew to the controller. The controller's failure to provide terrain clearance instructions to the flightcrew, and failure to advise the flightcrew of minimum safe altitude warning alerts. Contributing to the accident was the pilots' fatigue which likely contributed to their degraded decision making.": "Altitude",

  "The plane entered a spiral descent and broke up. It found the captain noticed a fuel imbalance and opened the crossfeed. This resulted in the plane being flown at a large sideslip angle while still under autopilot control, by means of the rudder trim mechanism. Forty-seven seconds after the cross flow was opened, there was a  \"bank angle\" warning, followed by a warning chime that was presumably a warning they were straying from their correct altitude. The autopilot disengaging, probably due to a servo reaching its torque limit. This meant that there was no compensation applied for the rudder trim input, and the plane entered a roll and steep descent, disintegrating around FL 199. The investigation found poor visibility at night in low cloud was a factor in preventing the pilots realizing sooner.": "Spiral descent",

  "The aircraft developed engine trouble while en route from Bari Italy to Djerba, Tunisia The crew contacted Palermo ATC for an emergency landing but ditched into the sea approximately 19 miles north of Palermo. The pilot reported that both engines had failed. Fuel starvation. The maintenance crew incorrectly installed a fuel gauge for a ATR-42 on the ATR-72. Both instruments look very similar. A contributing factor was the failure of the crew to carry out proper emergency procedures once the plane ran out of fuel. In March 2009, an Italian court sentenced the pilot, to 10 years of jail for manslaughter. Prosecutors said that after the plane's engines stopped functioning, Garbi failed to follow emergency procedures, and that he could possibly have reached runway 25 of Palermo \"Punta Raisi\" Airport, or even the standard runway 20.

  "While flying at FL340 towards Athens the crew reported problems with their air conditioning system. As the airliner entered Greek airspace ATC lost contact with the plane. Two Greek F-16 fighters were dispatched to intercept the plane. The F-16 pilots reported that one pilot was not in the cockpit and the other was slumped over the controls. They also said oxygen masks had deployed in the cabin. The plane continued on its programmed route to a holding pattern off the coast of Greece and flew in circles for two hours. Meanwhile, at least two flight attendants had stayed awake using portable oxygen bottles but they couldn't get through the locked, terrorist-proof cockpit door. It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromou, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control had been  left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists. They failed to respond to warnings as oxygen masks fell in the passenger cabin which eventually  led to the two pilots losing consciousness and the plane crashing.": "Engine failure",
  "While en route, the crew reported engine trouble with both engines and planed to divert to Caracas. The plane began losing altitude and eventually crashed in the Sierra de Perija mountains on the Columbian-Venezuelan border. The autopilot might have reduced engine power too much after a rapid climb to FL330, allowing airspeed to bleed off to the point of a stall. Also the data recorder showed that rather than push the nose over to recover from the stall, the pilots held the yoke to their chests all the way to the ground. It has also been suggesting that a buildup of ice inside each engine's PT2 probe was responsible for the accident.": "Engine trouble",
  "The plane was about to land at Pucallpa when it ran into strong winds from a tropical storm.

Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C.": "Autobrake",

The plane skidded off the end of the runway across a major roadway and struck a gas station and building, bursting into flames.  The right engine had a malfunctioning reverser. In this situation, the correct procedure was for the pilot to retard both throttles to idle and then advance both throttles to reverse, as if he had no problem with the reversers. The former procedure, which was changed by Airbus, was to take both throttles to idle, and then advance just the throttle corresponding to the engine with the operating reverser. It was changed by Airbus because there had been several incidents where the pilot forgot to bring both throttles back to idle, leaving one engine reversed and the other thrusting forward. The downside to this change was it would lengthen the stopping distance. The pilot was so concerned about the short and slippery runway that he chose to switch to the old procedure and got it wrong. A contributing factor was the heavy rain and wind and the fact that the newly resurfaced runway had not had grooves installed yet.": "Reverser",

An investigation showned that the fuel flow to both engines was restricted; most probably due to ice within the fuel feed system. The ice is likely to have formed from water that occurred naturally in the fuel, and should have been melted by the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE).  However, the FOHE did not heat its own inlet  face, and investigation showed that, although the flight was   within the certified operational envelope at all times, a long   period of low fuel flow in an unusually cold environment, followed  by a throttle increase, could cause an ice jam at that point.

  "A helicopter bound for offshore oil fields went down about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans shortly after taking off. The sudden loss of power to both engines that resulted from impact with a red-tailed hawk, which fractured the windshield and interfered with engine fuel controls and the subsequent disorientation of the flightcrrew members. Also the lack of FAA regulations and guidance at the time the helicopter was certificated requiring helicopter windshields to be resistant to bird strikes and the lack of protections that would prevent T-handles from inadvertently dislodging out of the detents and the lack of a master warning light and audible system to alert the flightcrew of low-rotor speed conditions.": "Bird strikes",

The captainÃ¢ÂÂs inappropriate response to the activation of the stick shaker, which led to an aerodynamic stall from which the airplane did not recover. Contributing to the accident were (1) the flight crewÃ¢ÂÂs failure to monitor airspeed in relation to the rising position of the low-speed cue, (2) the flight crewÃ¢ÂÂs failure to adhere to sterile cockpit procedures, (3) the captainÃ¢ÂÂs failure to effectively manage the flight, and (4) Colgan AirÃ¢ÂÂs inadequate procedures for airspeed selection and management during approaches in icing conditions.": "Failure",

  "The Airbus went missing over the Atlantic Ocean on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. The plane departed from Rio de Janeiro-Galeao International Airport at 19:03 LT bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The last radio contact with the flight was at 01:33 UTC.  The aircraft left CINDACTA III radar coverage at 01:48 UTC, flying normally at FL350. The aircraft reportedly went through a thunderstorm with strong turbulence at 02:00 UTC. At 02:14 UTC an automated message was received indicating a failure of the electrical system. The plane carried 12 crew members and 216 passengers. The wreckage was finally discovered on April 3, 2011 using unmanned submarines.  Flight447 passed into clouds associated with a large system of thunderstorms, its speed sensors became iced over, and the autopilot disengaged. In the ensuing confusion, the pilots lost control of the airplane because they reacted incorrectly to the loss of instrumentation and then seemed unable to comprehend the nature of the problems they had caused. Neither weather nor malfunction doomed flight, nor a complex chain of error, but a simple but persistent mistake on the part of one of the pilots.    The crew did not realize the plane was in a stall, were insufficiently trained in flying manually, and never informed the passengers that anything was wrong before they plunged into the sea. The captain was on a rest break when the warnings began. The two co-pilots were facing faulty speed readings from unreliable sensors and repeated alarm signals, but fail to explain why the pilots responded the way they did. It's unclear why the co-pilot at the controls maintained a nose-up input - contrary to the normal procedure to come out of an aerodynamic stall. Normally, the nose should be pointed slightly downward to regain lift in such a stall, often caused because the plane is traveling too slowly. A basic maneuver for stall recovery, which pilots are taught at the outset of their flight training, is to push the yoke forward and apply full throttle to lower the nose of the plane and build up speed. The report confirms that external speed sensors obstructed by ice crystals produced irregular speed readings on the plane. Since the accident, Air France has replaced the speed monitors on all its Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft. The BEA said neither of the co-pilots at the controls had received recent training for manual aircraft handling, or had any high-altitude schooling in case of unreliable air speed readings. A stall warning sounded numerous times, and once for a full 54 seconds, but the crew made no reference to it in cockpit exchanges before the jet crashed.": "crash cause",
